 "description": "the national records of scotland (nrs) is responsible for the organisation and administration of the records of births in scotland.  data on births for calendar years relate to the date of registration of the event and not the date of occurrence. data on births between mid points of years are based on date of occurrence and refer to the number of births which occurred between 1 july of the previous year and 30 june of the year specified in the data.  births are counted on the basis of the area of usual residence of the mother if that is in scotland, otherwise they are counted on the basis of the place of birth.",
